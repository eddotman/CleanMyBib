# Functions

From an input bibtex file, the script will create a new and nicely formated bibtex file.
The journal name could be formated into a long (complete) or short (abbreviate) format based on the PubMed database
[Pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals).
The page numbers could also be formatted into a long (e.g. 1125--1138) or short (1125--38) version.

The new file is called "Clean-*original_filename*".
The reference are sorted by citation keys and only the minimum needed fields are displayed.

The format options and the fields to keep could be chosen in the script or in the GUI version.

If page numbers or journal names are missing, a log file (CleanMyBib.log) will be created and will indicate the citation keys of the references. The script is smart enough to detect if the reference should not have pages numbers as "in press" articles or books.


# Dependences

The script is based on [Python](http://http://www.python.org/) 2.x.
If you don't have a working version of Python, you can download it [here](http://http://www.python.org/download/).

The bibtex references are parsed by the Pybtex module. You can download a version of [Pybtex](http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/#download), it's free and works on all platforms.
To install Pybtex, go the folder downloaded and simply run this command:

    python setup.py install

For the GUI version, you need to have a working version of [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/) and [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro).
