[DESCRIPTION]
    The script offers a simple Tkinter graphical interface or a more advanced version in PyQt.
    You can load a bibtex file, and the script will automatically run.
    The script will:
        - remove the URL, number and month lines,
        - capitalize the right words of the journal's names,
        - change the page numbers of the last pages (or add XXXX if there is no information).


[OPTIONS]
    You can change between a 'Vancouver' style and an 'APA' style.
    APA -> Journal name in the long format (e.g., Journal of Experimental Psychology) 
		and all the page numbers displayed (e.g. 1151 -- 1159).
    Vancouver -> Journal name in the short format (e.g. J EXP PSYCHOL)
		and trunked repeated page numbers (e.g. 11151 -- 9).
